Supported Build Targets
-----------------------

SPL Core reuses the concept of build kits from the VS Code extension *CMake Tools*. Currently, two build kits
are defined and supported:

* *prod*: compilation and linking of an executable for a specific target device.
* *test*: compilation, linking and execution of SW component tests, creation of documentation and reports.

Build kit *prod*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Build Kit Prod
   :status: done

   SPL Core shall provide a build kit called 'prod'.

.. req:: Build Kit Test
   :status: done

   SPL Core shall provide a build kit called 'test'.


Build kit *test*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. req:: Support Component and Unit Testing
   :status: done

   Build kit 'test' shall provide a build target '<component>_unittests', that executes all tests of a SW component
   and creates a junit.xml with the results.

.. req:: Support Testing
   :status: done

   Build kit 'test' shall provide a build target 'unittests', that executes all tests of all SW components.

.. req:: Support Creation of Documentation
   :status: open

   Build kit 'test' shall provide a build target '<component>_docs', that creates documentation of a SW component.
   Precondition of this build target is the existence of a doc folder inside the component's folder containing at
   least a conf.py.

.. req:: Support Documentation
   :status: open

   Build kit 'test' shall provide a build target 'docs', that creates the documentation of all SW components.

.. req:: Support Creation of a Component Report
   :status: open

   Build kit 'test' shall provide a build target '<component>_report', that creates a report of a SW component containing
   the documentation, test specification and all test results.
   Precondition of this build target is the existence of a conf.py and index.rst inside the root folder of a component.

.. req:: Creation of Sphinx Output
   :status: open

   Call of sphinx-build takes care of the dependencies and makes incremental builds.
   SPL Core shall always start the docs target for generating the documentation and let sphinx-build handle the dependencies.

.. req:: Configurable Sphinx Output
   :status: open

   The documentation shall be configurable. One should be able to generate the variant specific documentation, i.e.,
   only the variant specific components and their features shall be part of the documentation.

.. req:: Project Documentation
   :status: open

   The project's index.rst file shall be static but changeable and configurable.

Dependencies of Build Targets
-----------------------------

The build targets

* docs
* reports

are just virtual targets generating several documents, one for each component.

On the other hand the build targets

* doc
* report

are real targets generating exactly one document including all components.

.. mermaid::

   graph TB
       unittests --> component_unittests["&lt;component&gt;_unittests"]
       docs --> component_docs["&lt;component&gt;_docs"]
       reports --> component_report["&lt;component&gt;_reports"]
       doc
       report


Folder Structure for Report Creation
------------------------------------

::

         test/
         src/
            <Component>/
               doc/
               html/
                  index.html (<Component>_DetailedDesign)
               test/
               html/

         test/
            <Component>_test.cc
            index.rst
         conf.py
         index.rst


Sphinx Build Configuration
--------------------------

Sphnix build required configuration file(conf.py) and main rst(index.rst) file are located in same folder.
Because of this:

  * we need conf.py and index.rst files in the root directory
  * the index.rst file dynamically includes the target index.rst
  * the conf.py file needs to read a configuration file (config.json) to be able to find all the relevant files for the current CMake docs target 


conf.py
^^^^^^^

  * conf.py is a static file and we do not know the path of config.json file, we need to get the path to it as an environment variable
  * we should check, if environment variable(SPHINX_BUILD_CONFIGURATION_FILE) exists just load the content and store into the html_context(https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-html_context)
  
index.rst
^^^^^^^^^

This file just includes the target index.rst depending on the ``docs`` CMake target.


Component Docs CMake Target
---------------------------

A component docs target ``<component>_docs`` will be created automatically if there is an index.rst file in the component ``doc`` directory.
Only the files included in the ``doc`` folder are part of the report. Therefore, there will be no traceability to IDs from ``src`` or ``test``.

Execution steps: 

* we need to create config.json
* we need to create an index.rst file which includes
    * component detailed design rst file
* we need to call sphinx-build "pipenv run sphinx-build -b html . build/<Variant>/test/src/<Component>/docs/html"
    * source directory is always a projet root directory and output directory is build/<Variant>/test/src/<Component>/docs/


Component Reports CMake Target
------------------------------

* this target depends on ``unittests`` target
* we need to create config.json file
* we need to create an index.rst file, which includes
    * component detailed design rst file
    * component test results rst file
    * component doxygen rst file
* we need to create a test_results.rst file to include the componenet junit test results.
* we need to copy Doxyfile from the docs folder and then we have to update the paths where Doxyfile should find the sources
* we need to call sphinx-build "pipenv run sphinx-build -b html . build/<Variant>/test/src/<Component>/reports/html"
    * source directory is always a projet root directory and output directory is build/<Variant>/test/src/<Component>/reports/


Documentation for a Component Report
------------------------------------

Since we are using Sphinx to build the documentation, the documentation must be in `reStructured text <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_.

For a comprehensive example on how to document a component for a component report, refer to the `SPLed repository <https://github.com/avengineers/SPLed/blob/develop/src/light_controller>`_.


Software Detailed Design Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inside the ``doc`` folder of a component you can write the component's ``software detailed design`` in the ``index.rst`` file.

To document the software detailed design for a component, follow these steps:

1. Begin with a title for the document and a table of contents title. Specify the depth to determine how many subchapters will be expanded in the table of contents.

2. Align to the left column of the document and use the ``.. spec:: <title for the specification>`` directive.

3. Break a line and align to the ``spec`` directive the line containing the representative id for the component using the structure ``:id: SWDD_<Component name or acronym>-<an id, e.g., 001>``.

4. For other attributes, break a new line and maintain alignment to the ``spec`` directive. For instance, you can add an attribute to present the integrity level of the component using the following directive ``:integrity: <A, B, C, or D>``.

5. Add the specification text in a new line aligned to the ``spec`` directive. Be creative in presenting the detailed design. If necessary, use tools like `mermaid diagrams <https://sphinxcontrib-mermaid-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_, `tables <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#tables>`_, or `images <https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/images.html>`_.

6. Make the documentation configurable where you judge necessary. For this, add: ``{% if config.CONFIGURATION_NAME %}`` in the beginning of a specific part of the software detailed design specification and ``{% endif %}`` at the end of the corresponding part that might be configurable.


Source Code Traceability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To establish traceability between source code and software detailed design, add Sphinx-needs (impl, id, implements) to the ``.c`` file of the component.

In order to do that, go to a function you want to make the traceability. Add on the top of this function a comment starting and ending with the ``rst`` tag. For example:

.. code-block:: c

   /*!
   * @rst
   *
   * .. impl:: functionName
   *    :id: IMPL_ComponentName-001
   *    :implements: SWDD_ComponentName-<an id, e.g., 001>, SWDD_ComponentName-<an id, e.g., 002>
   *
   *    Some function documentation
   *    ...
   *
   * @endrst
   */
   void functionName(void) {
      implementation...
   }


Test Code Traceability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To establish traceability between source code, software detailed design, and test code, add Sphinx-needs (test, id, tests) to the test cases in the ``.cc`` test file of the component. For example:

.. code-block:: c

   /*!
   * @rst
   *
   * .. test:: ComponentName.TestCaseName
   *    :id: TS_ComponentName-001
   *    :tests: SWDD_ComponentName-<an id, e.g., 001>, SWDD_ ComponentName-<an id, e.g., 002>
   *
   * @endrst
   */
   TEST(ComponentName, TestCaseName)
   {
      implementation...
   }


Generating a Component Report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Build and generate a component report by selecting the build kit ``test`` and the build target corresponding to your component, e.g., ``src_componentName_report``. 
To build for all components of your variant, use the build target ``reports``.

The component report is available in <project>/build/<variant>/test/src/<component>/reports/html. Open the ``index.html`` file in a web browser.
